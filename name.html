<p>  I am from China, and here's some pronunciation tips for my name --- <b>Peizhao
Ou</b> --- in Mandarin Chinese:
</p>

<font size="5">
<ul>

<li> 
Unlike English, the Chinese language is based on characters (each character
is mapped to a syllable).
</li>

<li> 
The family name is before the given name, and in most cases the family name is
the first character, and all other charaters together represent the given name.
</li>

<li> Based on the above, my name should be <b>"Ou Pei Zhao"</b>, which is a
one-to-one mapping from each charater to its syllable. 

<ul>
<li>
"Ou" is pronounced as the English word "Oh" --- my family name.
</li>

<li>
"Pei" is as the English word "Pay"
</li>

<li>
"Zhao" is like "jow" (the 'j' is pronounced like the 'G' in "George", and the
"ow" is like the "ow" in "wow").
</li>

</ul>

Thus, people usually call me <b>Peizhao </b> as "Pay-Jow". However, you could
improvise.

</li>

</ul>
